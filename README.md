# Node.js Design Patterns [Video]
This is the code repository for [Node.js Design Patterns [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/nodejs-design-patterns-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789538397), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
When writing Node.js applications, it’s absolutely imperative that we employ battle-tested guidelines that can help us write efficient and resilient code. These guidelines are known as design patterns. Design patterns are an important part of software development and are a proven way of solving a given problem.

In this course, you’ll take a comprehensive look at industry-standard design patterns, identify challenges that you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software, and implement solutions in Node.js applications. The efficacy of these patterns has been proven over time and a lot of these standard patterns can be implemented when writing JavaScript apps with Node.js. 

By implementing design patterns, you can write code that is crafted for efficiency and reusability and is resilient against errors and typical pitfalls that result from poorly written code.

<H2>What You Will Learn</H2>
<DIV class=book-info-will-learn-text>
<UL>
<LI>Understand the importance of learning and using industry-standard design patterns when writing Node.js apps 
<LI>Learn more about core creational design patterns such as Singletons, Factory, and Builder patterns
<LI>Efficiently avoid callback hell and implement asynchronous behavior using Promises, Async/Await, and Generators
<LI>Develop a deeper understanding of the module system in Node.js and to implement patterns such as dependency injection
<LI>Get an insight into structural design patterns such as Proxy, Adapter, Decorator, and others that can help you create systematic, efficient relationships between objects and entities
<LI>Reuse well-known techniques to solve common design and coding issues
<LI>Understand the behavioral design patterns such as Strategy, Observers, Middleware, and even the Publisher-Subscriber pattern to craft efficient communication patterns between objects, processes, and even applications </LI></UL></DIV>
